Some carrots are bad!
---
The flower tells you which carrot.
---
There are 3 carrots. Each carrot has a different size:

  * The small carrot has the size 1.
  * The middle carrot has the size 2.
  * The big carrot has the size 3.

When Algo looks at the flower with ![](commands/memorize_flower.svg) he learns ![](assets/brain.svg)
which carrot you have to eat.

Algo can solve this puzzle in different ways:

  * He can take a carrot ![](commands/get_carrot.svg) to the flower ![](commands/jump.svg), and compare it to the flower ![](commands/if_same.svg).
  * He can go to the flower ![](commands/jump.svg), look at the flower ![](commands/memorize_flower.svg), and then compare the memorized number ![](assets/brain.svg) to a carrot ![](commands/if_same.svg).
  * He can memorize the size of a carrot ![](commands/memorize_carrot.svg), go to the flower ![](commands/jump.svg), and then compare the memorized number ![](assets/brain.svg) to the flower ![](commands/if_same.svg).

__Important__: you have to run your CISC twice without changing it to win.
