On the left side is the list of available instructions. Drag instructions below
![](assets/start.svg) to create Carrot Instruction Set Code (CISC), that Algo
will follow to gather carrots.

Use ![](assets/mission.svg) to show details and helpful tips, and
![](assets/play.svg) to try things out. Try things out :-)!

Use ![](commands/eat_carrot.svg) to let Algo eat the carrot in front of him,
and ![](commands/forward.svg) to let Algo jump one field in the direction he is
facing. If Algo jumps into a hole or onto a carrot, you have to stop with
![](assets/reset.svg) and restart with ![](assets/play.svg).
