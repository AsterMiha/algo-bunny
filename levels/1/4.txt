Carrot Flower!

Eat all carrots.

Again Algo has to eat all carrots. But this time Algo has to turn
![](commands/left.svg) or ![](commands/right.svg) in a loop
![](commands/loop.svg)!

In order to stop the loop ![](commands/loop.svg) Algo has to check
if there is grass in front of him  ![](commands/if_empty.svg) instead of a
carrot.

Because when there is grass, he has to stop eating.
