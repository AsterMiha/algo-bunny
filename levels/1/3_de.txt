Carrots on a stick!

Eat all carrots.

Again Algo has to eat all carrots. But this time you have only one
![](commands/eat_carrot.svg) and one ![](commands/forward.svg) available. Try
to let Algo eat ![](commands/eat_carrot.svg) and walk ![](commands/forward.svg)
again and again like that:

![example](help/3_1.png)

This is called doing a loop ![](commands/loop.svg)!

But when should Algo stop? When there is a hole in front of him:
![](commands/if_hole.svg)! If there is a hole, Algo has to stop doing the loop
![](commands/break.svg) like this:
