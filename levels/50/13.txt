The flowers will give you hints!
---
Eat as many carrots as the flowers tell you.
---
When Algo looks at the flower with ![](commands/memorize_flower.svg) he learns ![](assets/brain.svg)
how many flowers he to has eat.

Each flower gives him exactly the same hint, but each time you press
![](assets/play.svg), the flowers contain different numbers.

When Algo is counting his steps ![](commands/memorize_steps.svg) he knows how
many carrots he has eaten - because he each time takes a step forward when he
eats a carrot.

__But wait__: as soon as Algo looks at a flower
![](commands/memorize_flower.svg), he forgets how many carrots he has eaten!

So Algo should not look at the flowers, but just compare ![](commands/if_same.svg) if the steps in his brain ![](assets/brain.svg)
match the number contained in each flower.

___Important___: you have to run your CISC twice without changing it to win.
