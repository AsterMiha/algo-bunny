Counting your steps ![](commands/memorize_steps.svg) gives you an idea how many
carrots you have eaten.  Jumping is easy: drag any location on the field onto
the jump instruction ![](commands/jump.svg) in the editor. Jumping is also
very exiting. So Algo always remembers where he has jumped from, and can jump back
to the last jump location with ![](commands/jump_back.svg).
